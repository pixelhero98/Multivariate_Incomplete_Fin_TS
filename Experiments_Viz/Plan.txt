Part 1 & 2 (Statistical & Financial Performance): You prove that the model works and is superior to baselines, both statistically and in a practical, financial sense. This is the most important foundation. Adding RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is a good idea as it's a standard metric and complements MSE by bringing the error back to the original units.

Part 3 (Probabilistic Forecasting): You showcase the model's key advantage—its generative, probabilistic nature. This is a crucial differentiator from deterministic models.

Part 4 & 5 (S-Domain Visualization): You provide deep interpretability, showing how the novel components of your LLapDiT architecture are learning. Comparing the initial and final pole distributions is a sophisticated method for visualizing the learning process.

Part 6 (Ablation Study): You scientifically validate your architectural choices by comparing the different Laplace modes.

To be added:
1. Robustness to Missing Data (Showcase Your Key Strength)
You've built your system to handle real-world data with missing entities. You should conduct a formal experiment to prove its superiority under non-ideal conditions.

What to do: Create a controlled experiment where you compare your model against baselines at different levels of data sparsity. You can use your coverage parameter to control this. For example, create test sets with 90%, 70%, and 50% coverage.

Visualization: Plot a line chart where the x-axis is "Data Coverage (%)" and the y-axis is MAE. You will likely show that while all models' performance degrades as data becomes sparser, your model's performance degrades much more gracefully.

Impact: This is a powerful result that proves your model is not just a "fair-weather" forecaster but a robust tool built for real-world, imperfect data.

2. Computational Efficiency Analysis
Reviewers at top conferences are always interested in the practical viability of a new architecture.

What to do: Create a simple table comparing your model against key baselines (especially other Transformer-based models) on two metrics:

Training Time: Time to convergence or time per epoch.

Inference Speed: Time to generate a forecast for a single batch.

Impact: Even if your model is not the absolute fastest, providing these numbers shows a thorough evaluation and helps position your model in the literature. If your model is more efficient than a comparable baseline, it's a significant advantage.

============ Baselines ===================
DLinear (LTSF-Linear) — tough linear baseline for long horizons; fast and stable. (over test / 1 mon = 20 steps pred, MAE = 0.6, MSE = 0.64, our best now MAE = 0.498, MSE = 0.51, 
pinball loss (0.1, 0.5, 0.9) = 0.21, 0.24, 0.26)

FEDformer (small) - seasonal–trend decomposition + frequency-domain attention (Fourier), complementary to PatchTST/iTransformer’s CI attention.

N-HiTS — competitive deep forecaster; excels at multi-scale patterns.

PatchTST (small) — patch-based Transformer; strong on long sequences with CI training.

iTransformer (small) — modern CI Transformer; complements PatchTST design.

TiDE — fast MLP sequence model; strong point-forecast efficiency baseline.

TimeGrad (light) — diffusion forecaster; closest apples-to-apples to LLapDiT.

ScoreGrad (light) — a score-based SDE diffusion forecaster (continuous-time) rather than a DDPM-style model like TimeGrad, a complementary diffusion approach.
